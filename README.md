# TicTacToe
A simple python project emulating the legacy game 'TicTacToe'

To play the game, run the file module 'Play.py' using the python command as shown below:
  $python Play.py
  
Keep in mind:
# Since the game uses some os and system level calls, the program will work only on a linux platform with python installed in it.

Happy TicTacToe!!
